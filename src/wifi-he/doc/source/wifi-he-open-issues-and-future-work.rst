Open Issues and Future Work
***************************

Open Issues and Future Work in the underlying Wi-Fi model
=========================================================

Channel model D integration (issue #4)

Enable Time trace callback from MacLow to capture AMPDU and Block Ack
events, for calibration checkpoints (issue #12)

Fix or cleanup disable wifi-he tests (issue #56)

Plot throughput results for Bianchi uplink scenario as N is varied (issue #61)

Document AP(s) in Bianchi test (issue #69)

The Bianchi validation tests would benefit from plots showing the 
theoretical results on the plots vs. the simulation results. (issue #73)

Block ack frame format (issue #80)

Open Issues and Future Work in the spatial reuse scenarios
==========================================================

Plot the CDF of latency per flow (issue #33)

Implement additional wish-list of spatial reuse scenario features
and metrics (issues #10 #14)

Merge study1.sh and study2.sh into single script (issue #82)

Open Issues and Future Work in the other scenarios
==================================================

Propagation models need updating, documentation, testing (issue #1)

Integrate and test LAA code (issue #5)

Some Calibration Box5 scenarios crash ns-3 (issue #43)

Rework scripts to avoid files in top-level directory ((issue #77)
